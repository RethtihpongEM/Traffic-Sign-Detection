- Kong Rattanakpanha
- Chanrith Natvaddhtharo
- Tep Sovannpanha

## Steps for running code

- Run preprocessing.ipynb in the Preprocessing folder

1. CNN-KERAS
- Run model_cnn_keras.ipynb to train the model
- Run model_cnn_keras_test.ipynb to test the model with the saved model called model_cnn_keras.h5

2. YOLOv8
- Change the train and test data directory in the yaml file
- Run yolo.ipynb to train the model
- Run yolo-val.ipynb to evaluate the model's performance
- Run yolo-test.ipynb to test the model
- The runs folder is autogenerated during training and validating which will contain all the results.
Note: 
- saved_model.pt is the model that train using 'GTSRB' dataset
    - are trained with 42 classes of traffic sign (various signs)
    - ability: 
        - know various signs
        - cannot predict bigger picture (with cars or trees or else)
    - reference: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign
- v2_saved_model.pt is the model that train using 'Signs Detection For Self-Driving Cars (Computer Vision Project)' dataset
    - are train with 15 classes (traffic light, speed limit sign, stop sign)
    - ability: 
        - know some classes especially speed limit sign
        - can predict bigger picture (landscape, trees, cars, ...etc)

3. EffiecientDet
- Run EfficientDet.ipynb to train and evaluate the model

4. VGG-19
- Run VGG-19.ipynb to train the model
- Run vgg19_test.ipynb to evaluate the model
