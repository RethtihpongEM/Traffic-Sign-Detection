# Traffic Sign Detection

## Group 5:
- Em Ormreth Rethtihpong
- Kong Rattanakpanha
- Chanrith Natvaddhtharo
- Tep Sovannpanha

## Steps for running code

- Run preprocessing.ipynb in the Preprocessing folder

1. CNN-KERAS
- Run model_cnn_keras.ipynb to train the model
- Run model_cnn_keras_test.ipynb to test the model with the saved model called model_cnn_keras.h5

2. YOLOv8
- Change the train and test data directory in the yaml file
- Run yolo.ipynb to train the model
- Run yolo-val.ipynb to evaluate the model's performance
- Run yolo-test.ipynb to test the model
- The runs folder is autogenerated during training and validating which will contain all the results.

3. EffiecientDet
- Run EfficientDet.ipynb to train and evaluate the model

4. VGG-19
- Run VGG-19.ipynb to train the model
- Run vgg19_test.ipynb to evaluate the model
